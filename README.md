## **Welcome to Ceridwen!**

Ceridwen will provide you with some basic world data to get your server up and running, as well as examples, templates and documentation for creating your own Hybrasyl server.

This repository is intended for those with some experience with lua and xml.  Hybrasyl has both an api and a schema:

[Scripting API](https://www.hybrasyl.com/docs/api/Hybrasyl.Scripting.html)  
XML Schema (link tbd)

For an overview of how to set up Hybrasyl for use, please visit the [server project](https://github.com/hybrasyl/server).
